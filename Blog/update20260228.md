Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a quick update regarding the Mathematics section of the website.

We know that preparing for the 11+ can feel like a long journey, and often the hardest part for students is staying consistent without running out of practice material. To help with this, I’ve decided to start a new routine: every Friday， I will be releasing a fresh set of mathematics questions.

My hope is that this gives students something new to look forward to each week, helping them build momentum and stay sharp.

For the time being, these updates will focus solely on **Mathematics**. I am still working hard behind the scenes to update the English and Reasoning sections, and I’ll let you know as soon as those are ready.

I hope these new questions prove helpful for your revision this weekend. If you have any feedback or specific topics you’d like to see covered, feel free to reach out.

Happy practicing!
