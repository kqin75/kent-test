    "passage": "The Iron Woman\nby Ted Hughes\n\nThis passage is told from the perspective of Lucy, who lives near a marsh. Strange things have been happening in the area — fish and birds have been dying, and the water in the rivers and streams has turned murky. Lucy has gone to the marsh at dawn to investigate.\n\n1. The mist hung low over the marsh, barely shifting in the still morning air. Lucy crept forward, her boots sinking into the soft ground with each careful step. She had told nobody where she was going. The village was still asleep behind her, a cluster of dark shapes beneath the grey sky.\n\n5. Then she saw it — or rather, her. Rising from the muddy water at the edge of the marsh stood a figure so vast that Lucy's mind could not at first make sense of it. The shape was that of a woman, but a woman made entirely of iron. Her skin was dark metal, pitted and rough, streaked with rust the colour of dried blood. She stood as tall as the church steeple, and her eyes — two \n10. glowing discs — stared straight ahead with an expression that was impossible to read.\n\nLucy's first instinct was to run. Every nerve in her body screamed at her to turn and flee back to the safety of the village. But something held her there. Perhaps it was curiosity. Perhaps it was the strange feeling that the Iron Woman was not dangerous — not to her, at least. The figure had not moved. She stood as still as a statue, waist-deep in the dark water, and \n15. Lucy realised with a jolt that she was weeping. Great silent tears of rust rolled down the iron cheeks and dropped into the marsh below.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Lucy whispered, though she did not expect an answer.\n\nThe Iron Woman's mouth opened slowly, with a grinding creak like an ancient gate. When she spoke, her voice was deep and resonant, vibrating through the ground beneath Lucy's feet.\n20. \"I have come,\" she said, \"because the water is dying.\"\n\nLucy stared. She thought of the dead fish she had seen floating belly-up in the stream last week, and the herons that had abandoned their nests by the river. Something cold settled in her stomach.\n\n\"The factories,\" the Iron Woman continued, her voice now trembling with barely contained \n25. fury, \"pour their poison into the rivers. The rivers carry it to the sea. The creatures that live in the water are choking.\" She paused, and her glowing eyes finally turned to look directly at Lucy. \"And nobody listens.\"\n\nLucy swallowed hard. She wanted to say something — anything — but no words came. Instead, she simply nodded. The Iron Woman seemed to understand, because something in \n30. her expression softened, and she extended one enormous hand, palm upward, towards the girl.\n\n\"Will you help me?\" she asked.\n\nLucy looked at the vast iron hand. It could have crushed her like a pebble. But she thought of the dead fish, the poisoned water, the silent riverbanks where birdsong had once filled the \n35. air.

    "passage": "The Iron Woman\nby Ted Hughes\n\nThis passage is told from the perspective of Lucy, who lives near a marsh.

The village was still asleep behind her, a cluster of dark shapes beneath the grey sky.\n\n5. Then she saw it — or rather, her. Rising from the muddy water at the edge of the marsh stood a figure so vast that Lucy's mind could not at first make sense of it. The shape was that of a woman, but a woman made entirely of iron. Her skin was dark metal, pitted and rough, streaked with rust the colour of dried blood. She stood as tall as the church steeple, and her eyes — two \n10. glowing discs — stared straight ahead with an expression that was impossible to read.\n\nLucy's first instinct was to run. Every nerve in her body screamed at her to turn and flee back to the safety of the village. But something held her there. Perhaps it was curiosity. Perhaps it was the strange feeling that the Iron Woman was not dangerous — not to her, at least. The figure had not moved. She stood as still as a statue, waist-deep in the dark water, and \n15. Lucy realised with a jolt that she was weeping. Great silent tears of rust rolled down the iron cheeks and dropped into the marsh below.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Lucy whispered, though she did not expect an answer.\n\nThe Iron Woman's mouth opened slowly, with a grinding creak like an ancient gate. When she spoke, her voice was deep and resonant, vibrating through the ground beneath Lucy's feet.\n20. \"I have come,\" she said, \"because the water is dying.\"\n\nLucy stared. She thought of the dead fish she had seen floating belly-up in the stream last week, and the herons that had abandoned their nests by the river. Something cold settled in her stomach.\n\n\"The factories,\" the Iron Woman continued, her voice now trembling with barely contained \n25. fury, \"pour their poison into the rivers. The rivers carry it to the sea. The creatures that live in the water are choking.\" She paused, and her glowing eyes finally turned to look directly at Lucy. \"And nobody listens.\"\n\nLucy swallowed hard. She wanted to say something — anything — but no words came. Instead, she simply nodded. The Iron Woman seemed to understand, because something in \n30. her expression softened, and she extended one enormous hand, palm upward, towards the girl.\n\n\"Will you help me?\" she asked.\n\nLucy looked at the vast iron hand.

Rising from the muddy water at the edge of the marsh stood a figure so vast that Lucy's mind could not at first make sense of it. The shape was that of a woman, but a woman made entirely of iron. Her skin was dark metal, pitted and rough, streaked with rust the colour of dried blood. She stood as tall as the church steeple, and her eyes — two \n10. glowing discs — stared straight ahead with an expression that was impossible to read.\n\nLucy's first instinct was to run. Every nerve in her body screamed at her to turn and flee back to the safety of the village. But something held her there. Perhaps it was curiosity. Perhaps it was the strange feeling that the Iron Woman was not dangerous — not to her, at least. The figure had not moved. She stood as still as a statue, waist-deep in the dark water, and \n15. Lucy realised with a jolt that she was weeping. Great silent tears of rust rolled down the iron cheeks and dropped into the marsh below.\n\n\"Who are you?\" Lucy whispered, though she did not expect an answer.\n\nThe Iron Woman's mouth opened slowly, with a grinding creak like an ancient gate. When she spoke, her voice was deep and resonant, vibrating through the ground beneath Lucy's feet.\n20. \"I have come,\" she said, \"because the water is dying.\"\n\nLucy stared. She thought of the dead fish she had seen floating belly-up in the stream last week, and the herons that had abandoned their nests by the river. Something cold settled in her stomach.\n\n\"The factories,\" the Iron Woman continued, her voice now trembling with barely contained \n25. fury, \"pour their poison into the rivers. The rivers carry it to the sea. The creatures that live in the water are choking.\" She paused, and her glowing eyes finally turned to look directly at Lucy. \"And nobody listens.\"\n\nLucy swallowed hard. She wanted to say something — anything — but no words came. Instead, she simply nodded. The Iron Woman seemed to understand, because something in \n30. her expression softened, and she extended one enormous hand, palm upward, towards the girl.\n\n\"Will you help me?\" she asked.\n\nLucy looked at the vast iron hand. It could have crushed her like a pebble. But she thought of the dead fish, the poisoned water, the silent riverbanks where birdsong had once filled the \n35. air. She reached out and placed her own small hand upon the cold metal.\n\n\"Yes,\" she said.\n\n'It could have crushed her like a pebble.' (line 33)\n\nThis is an example of…",
